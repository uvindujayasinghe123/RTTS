As a key stop on the world spice trade routes, Sri Lanka has long held strategic importance for European trading powers. The country has been a colony of Portugal, the Netherlands, and most recently the British, and all these cultures blend with the native culture to form a wonderful hybrid. You can taste these influences in food, see them in architecture and the arts, and you can really feel them in Colombo." +
      "</p><p>The city is also filled with museums and other things to see and do that can help connect you with Sri Lankan culture. Colombo sits on the coast, and there's a large green space and beach area right in the heart of the city separating an area called Fort from the Indian Ocean. It's the city's public playground and a fun place to visit, especially on Friday and Saturday nights." +

      `<p>Galle Fort is an entire preserved walled town, now filled with boutique hotels, shops, and restaurants (along with real residents). The entire area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>` +
      `<p>This is a great place to explore on foot â€” the entire Fort area is car-free. It's hard to get lost, as you're surrounded on three sides by the sea.</p>` +
      `<p>Aside from and outside the fort, the city is surrounded by some amazing beaches. Like others in the country, the wide sand beach leads into clear, turquoise water. There's even a beach right beneath the iconic Galle lighthouse.</p>`,
